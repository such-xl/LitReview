With agent behaviors being unpredictable and the global reward ambiguous, current MARL methods face the challenges of nonstationarity and credit assignment. To address these, we propose a machine-aligned MARL framework for the DFJSP with stochastic job arrivals. An abstract stateaction representation, augmented with priority dispatching rules (PDRs), renders heterogeneous machines logically homogeneous, thereby enabling a unified policy that yields more coordinated behavior. A dense local reward signal combines sparse, unbiased tardiness variations with dense slack values that reflect potential tardiness, yielding a hybrid measure that integrates both realized outcomes and predictive information. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces total tardiness by 25.09% compared with classical dispatching rules and by $2 2 . 3 1 \\%$ compared with RL baselines on average across scenarios, achieving robust online scheduling performance. Furthermore, extensive validation confirms that the proposed reward exhibits a strong and statistically significant negative correlation with total tardiness, thereby ensuring its alignment with the scheduling objective.

        "text": "In prior work, MARL for DFJSP is commonly framed with heterogeneous agents, where machines and jobs constitute distinct roles with asymmetric observations and heterogeneous action spaces (routing vs. sequencing), operating under event-driven, asynchronous decisions and dynamically changing action sets [3, 4, 5, 6]. Such heterogeneity exacerbates non-stationarity, as the policy updates of one agent alter the decision environment of others, thereby leading to unstable learning dynamics [7, 6]. While centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) [1] and alternating training [8, 9] are widely used to mitigate these effects,these strategies only partially alleviate non-stationarity, as policy coupling and coordination overhead persist in heterogeneous systems [7]. Equally fundamental is credit assignment [10]. Global objectives such as total tardiness are sparse and delayed, with long-horizon interdependencies whereby early routing decisions influence downstream operations and due-date compliance[11, 12, 13]. Principled remedies like counterfactual baselines [14] face prohibitive costs as the joint action space and team size grow, especially under dynamic action availability. Consequently, many studies resort to heuristic reward shaping for denser feedback [1, 3], but designing signals that are fair across heterogeneous roles and aligned with global goals remains challenging. Taken together, agent heterogeneity and global, delayed objectives jointly give rise to non-stationarity and credit assignment—two persistent obstacles for MARL in DFJSP. ",

From the perspective of a single machine, state transitions and rewards are no longer stationary but shift with the scheduling behavior of other agents [48, 7, 11, 49]. This issue is particularly severe in DFJSP, where stochastic job arrivals, machine breakdowns, and evolving action sets continuously reshape the environment [36]. As a result, a decision that was optimal under one policy configuration may instantly become suboptimal once other machines adapt their strategies, leading to unstable or even divergent learning [50, 51]. Although approaches such as opponent modeling [52, 53, 54, 55] and distributed value-based methods [56, 48, 47] have been proposed, they still have significant limitations in DFJSP: opponent modeling suffers from poor scalability in large-scale real-time scheduling scenarios [57, 58], and distributed value-based methods may face convergence challenges in highly dynamic scheduling environments [59, 60, 61].

In DFJSP, this means the system can evaluate performance only after all jobs are completed, making it extremely difficult to attribute success or failure to individual machine decisions [63]. Simply distributing the global reward among all agents risks penalizing good decisions and rewarding poor ones, thereby misleading policy learning [64]. Although value decomposition methods [48, 7, 49] and counterfactual baselines [14] have been developed to address the credit assignment issue, they remain severely challenged in large-scale DFJSP environments. Their effectiveness is hampered by the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, the prohibitive computational cost of evaluating counterfactuals [65], and—most critically— the persistently sparse and delayed nature of the global reward signal in long-horizon scheduling problems [66], which tends to undermine learning efficiency and may lead to slow convergence. Consequently, recent studies have applied experience-based reward shaping [1, 3, 8, 45].

However, in practical scheduling scenarios, the number of candidate jobs varies dynamically across machines and time steps, resulting in a variable-sized action space. Although this direct action method is straightforward, it applies only to scheduling problems with a fixed or small number of jobs and machines. This contradicts the objective of this study, which targets dynamic scheduling environments with arbitrary numbers of jobs and machines. ",

        "text": "In this work, we propose a machine-aligned MARL framework for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling with stochastic job arrivals. Our framework activates a single idle machine at each scheduling event, while others are resolved sequentially with zero simulated latency. This method preserves the parallel nature of shop operations, eliminates artificial action conflicts, and mitigating environmental non-stationarity to facilitate credit assignment. We further design a compact, machine-aligned stateaction abstraction and a simple event-level objective signal based on changes in total tardiness and slack, enabling stable and efficient training using standard actor-critic methods without requiring specialized value decomposition or counterfactual reasoning techniques. Comprehensive experiments under varying workloads and shop sizes demonstrate consistent improvements over classical dispatching rules and existing MARL baselines. In particular, our framework achieves superior performance compared to asynchronous MAPPO, exhibiting stable convergence and low-latency decision-making suitable for real-time scheduling. ",

Notably, although the model was trained only on instances with 70 jobs, it performs well on significantly larger test cases, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability. We attribute this transferability to two key factors. First, both the state representation and the action space are based on features derived from classical PDRs, which are inherently local and scale-independent, enabling the model to generalize across different problem sizes. Second, the machine-centric agent design, where each machine makes decisions based on its local state using a shared policy, further decouples the scheduling logic from the global problem scale. ",

As a result, our framework maintains a high level of scheduling performance even in unseen and larger environments, demonstrating its practicality for real-world dynamic scheduling applications. ",

Likewise, the action space could be reformulated to directly select from candidate jobs, eliminating the intermediate reliance on rule-based prioritization. Such job-centric and representation-free formulations could potentially unlock more flexible and generalizable scheduling strategies, and leveraging advanced techniques such as graph neural networks or transformer-based models to capture structural and temporal dependencies in the environment.
